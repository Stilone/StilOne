## Hey 👋, I'm [Dmitry Astashin!](https://github.com/Stilone)



I am a self-taught front-end web developer who started from scratch and worked hard to reach where I am today. I successfully completed the Pochtatech bootcamp and received an offer at the state technology company RussianPost, which serves more than 80 million users.

I started to create a website that uses pure JavaScript to sell mobile phones, and continued to learn CSS and react. After a year of daily self-study, I started interviewing and honed my interview skills in order to find a job in a large government company where I have been working for more two a year. 

I am currently working on a personal blog/portfolio website and improving my English and Chinese language skills. In addition, I also participated in the development of a food startup company and completed the coding challenge on LeetCode to continue learning and developing my skills. 

My GitHub profile shows my journey from beginner to professional, and proves my dedication and persistence in pursuing a programming career.
